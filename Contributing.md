## Code

Initial parts of this codebase were written in Coffeescript. However, any 
updates and refactoring should be done in ES6, which implements many useful 
functions from Coffeescript but allows more people to read the code and 
contribute.
Generally, follow AirBnb's [Javascript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

## Testing

Clone this entire repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/TurkServer/turkserver-meteor.git turkserver
```

Then run the tests:

```
cd turkserver
meteor test-packages ./
```

If you checked out the repository into an existing Meteor app, you can run `meteor test-packages turkserver` from your app instead.

Browse to `http://localhost:3000` to run the tests.

You don't have to run the tests yourself; this project is set up for continuous integration on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/TurkServer/turkserver-meteor), which runs these tests on each commit.
